## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation & Running Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amanuel1221/alx-fe-reactjs.git
cd <project-folder>
npm install
npm run dev
Build for Production
npm run build


The build output will be in the dist/ folder (for Vite).

For projects with React Router, add _redirects (Netlify) or vercel.json (Vercel) to handle client-side routing.


💡 Usage

Navigate to each project folder, run npm install and npm run dev

Explore the functionality of each app: search, view details, interact with UI

Some projects require Firebase login to use features like favorites

🔮 Future Improvements

Add loading states and error handling in API calls

Implement pagination or infinite scroll for long lists

Add sorting/filtering features in apps with lists

Add dark mode or theme switching

Deploy all projects with live demo links on Netlify/Vercel

Add unit tests with Jest + React Testing Library
