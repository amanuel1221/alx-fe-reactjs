# 🚀 ALX React App (New)

A modern React application — part of my ALX Frontend learning path — built with Vite, showcasing React fundamentals, routing, and component‑based structure.  

---

## 📖 Project Description

This project was created to deepen my understanding of:

* React with Vite  
* Component‑based architecture  
* React Router for navigation  
* Modern JavaScript (ES6+)  
* Responsive UI with HTML & CSS (or your chosen styling)  

The app lives under the folder `alx-react-app-new`.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **React** (via Vite)  
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**  
* **HTML5 & CSS3** (or Tailwind / preferred styling)  
* **Node.js & npm** (for dependencies)  
* **React Router** (if the project uses multiple pages / routing)  
* **Git & GitHub** (version control)

## 🚀 Getting Started (Local Setup)


### Installation & Running Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amanuel1221/alx-fe-reactjs.git
cd alx-fe-reactjs/alx-react-app-new
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser at the port shown (e.g. `http://localhost:5173`) to view the app locally.

---

## 📦 Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a production‑ready build, usually in a folder named `dist/`. You can then deploy these files to any static hosting service (e.g. Vercel, Netlify).

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Add more features or pages  
* Improve styling / responsiveness  
* Add state management (if needed)

## 🙋‍♂️ Why This Project Matters

This project shows that I can:

* Set up and configure a modern React + Vite environment :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
* Organize code cleanly using components and React Router (if applicable)  
* Handle project structure, build scripts, and deployment‑ready output :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
* Demonstrate continuous learning and varied frontend skills
